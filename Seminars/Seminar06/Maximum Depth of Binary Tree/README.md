[Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
