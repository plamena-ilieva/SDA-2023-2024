[Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree)

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
